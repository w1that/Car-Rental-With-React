## Car Rental With React
 Car rental projects that allows users renting cars and companies to show  their rentals, built with React, Redux, JavaScript, semantic UI and CSS. I used my own API, so I had an opportunity to build a fullstack application like this one. You can check the backend's repo b clicking [here](https://github.com/w1that/Car-Rental-with-Java).
